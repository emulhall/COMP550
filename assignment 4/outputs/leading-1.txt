A Prairie Home Companion's Garrison Keillor fired over alleged improper behaviour
Retired last year from his longtime radio show, but still produced The Writer's Almanac
Garrison Keillor, the former host of A Prairie Home Companion, said Wednesday he has been fired by Minnesota Public Radio over allegations of improper behaviour. Keillor told The Associated Press of his firing in an email. In a followup statement, he said he was fired over "a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard."
